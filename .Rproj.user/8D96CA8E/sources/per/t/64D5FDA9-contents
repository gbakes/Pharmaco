# The Pharmaco Project

This the first draft of a mockup created to follow an online training engagement that rolled out company-wide to a large corporation of over 6000 employees.

The training engagement had 6 distinct training programs for each branch of the company (e.g. Finance, Legal, HR) over a set period of time, each of which had 5 levels or stages of progression.

During the training engagement, training documents, media and tests were completed by the employees. At various points in the engagement the employees created "commitments" which were to-dos aligned to the overarching goals of the training programs.
